##### Overview

Spend your Spring Break in Hawaii, getting in touch with the varied and at times dangerous landscape while coming to understand the historical development of the cultures who call the islands home. What does it mean to live sustainably on an island in the middle of the Pacific, and what can we learn from cultures that are unlike our own?
