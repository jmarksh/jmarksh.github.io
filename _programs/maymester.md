##### Overview

Visit two worlds in one program! Travel the east coast of Australia from Sydney to the Great Barrier Reef with a pitstop in the Outback. Experience New Zealand's "100% Pure" ethos on the South Island from coast to coast with a mountain hiatus in between. [An optional add-on 8-day program in Fiji](/programs/fiji/) is available to continue your journey abroad.
