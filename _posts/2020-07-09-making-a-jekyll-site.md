I haven't coded in a while, so this is slow going. But some people have never coded, so I'm beating them!

Static sites are really where it's at. I'm not in the biz, or whatever, but if you have a little coding know-how (or can be led to water), then your site will be way faster served as a static site.

Of course, this one doesn't look like much of anything at the moment. I'll take a screenshot and add it here once I get the basics up and running.
