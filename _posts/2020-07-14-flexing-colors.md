Getting things to do exactly what I wanted them to do took up a huge portion of the day, but it was actually a really simple solution in flexbox. I don't know why I'm so resistant of it. I guess I just feel like everything should work in grid -- flexbox feels hacky.

Then, I didn't even like the result! I was able to use it elsewhere, though.

Now I have to go do anything but this for a while. My plants are thirsty!

Site update: Added colors, it's no longer a "Hello, World!" page, and created a small profile section for me. LIke 3 lines of color coding and it looks like I should have bumped a whole version number -- I know better.
